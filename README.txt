This repository is a collection of thoughts, fragments, and working ideas.

They come from ongoing conversations—with people, with systems, and with myself over time.

I share them in case someone stumbles onto them and finds something useful, resonant, or worth pushing against.  
Agreement is not assumed. Disagreement is welcome.

If something here sparks a reaction—positive or negative—I’m always interested in hearing about it.  
The conversation is part of the work.
