## What this repository is

This repository contains the **canonical public version** of  
**“The Crossover — AI Iteration Density Theory.”**

This document is a first-person, long-form theoretical essay describing a
mechanism by which AI reshapes progress—not through intelligence in the abstract,
but through a structural increase in **iteration density**:
the rate at which hypothesis–test–feedback cycles can be executed per unit of time
and cost.

This repository exists to:
- establish public authorship
- provide an unambiguous timestamp
- preserve version integrity
- serve as the authoritative reference point

All other publications of this work (websites, articles, posts, mirrors) should
be considered **derivative copies** unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## What this theory claims (briefly)

The theory argues that AI’s most consequential impact is the collapse in the cost
of exploration and the acceleration of epistemic feedback loops.

As iteration density increases:
- discovery accelerates unevenly but compounds system-wide
- small actors gain disproportionate exploratory power
- institutions increasingly lag epistemically
- progress becomes self-reinforcing once AI-mediated discovery loops outrun
  human organizational latency (the “crossover”)

This framework is explicitly **not** a claim about consciousness, autonomy,
inevitability, or alignment. It is a claim about rates, feedback, and structural
constraints.

## What this theory does *not* attempt

- It does not predict specific outcomes.
- It does not claim moral directionality.
- It does not argue inevitability.
- It does not require AGI, autonomy, or self-modification.

It is a mechanistic lens, not a prophecy.
