A screen-share session.  
A prototype.  
A prompt.  
A response.

Nothing breaks.  
The demo works.

---

No one asks how it fails.

---

The meeting is called “Exploration Sync.”  
The calendar recurrence is weekly.

---

Someone says “we’ll harden it later.”  
No one pushes back.

---

The output is legible.  
The room relaxes.

---

No rollback is mentioned.

---

The follow-up email summarizes “next steps.”  
No one corrects the phrasing.

---

A second meeting appears.  
Same invite. New attendees.

---

The word “prototype” disappears.  
The word “roadmap” appears.

---

No owner is named.  
A deadline is.

---

Someone asks about latency.  
No one asks about liability.

---

A budget line is penciled in.  
It is described as provisional.

---

The meeting notes say “assume for now.”

---

No alternative path is discussed.

---

The demo is shown again.  
It looks the same.  
It feels different.

---

Legal is not present.

---

An integration partner is mentioned “just to explore.”

---

The phrase “edge cases” is used without examples.

---

A standing meeting is scheduled.  
Attendance is expected.

---

Ops is looped in after the date is fixed.

---

No one asks who turns it off.

---

The artifact is still described as optional.  
The dependency is not.

---

The code is not written yet.

---

The calendar is full.
