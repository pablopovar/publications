# Tab Suspension Method

This repository contains a short, first-person article describing a **workflow adaptation** developed while working extensively with ChatGPT in a browser.

It is **not** a tutorial, performance guide, or technical explanation of ChatGPT or browser internals.  
It is an observational account of a local performance issue and a small behavioral adjustment used to manage it.

## What this is

- A field report based on personal experience
- A description of a repeatable interaction pattern
- A document focused on clarity, not prescriptions

The article describes:
- A local system performance symptom observed during browser-based AI work
- How the issue was recognized and framed
- A simple tab-lifecycle pattern adopted in response
- The constraints and caveats involved

No claims of universality, optimization, or correctness are made.

## What this is not

- Not a recommendation
- Not a benchmark
- Not a browser or AI performance guide
- Not an explanation of how ChatGPT works internally
- Not advice

If the described behavior does not match your experience, no action is implied.

## Audience

The article is written for:
- Technology operators
- Executives working closely with AI tools
- Engineers and researchers familiar with complex software systems

It assumes technical literacy but avoids unnecessary jargon.

## Structure

The article progresses through:
1. Problem observation (local system behavior)
2. Pattern recognition
3. Constraint framing
4. Empirical experimentation
5. Workflow adaptation
6. Cautions and limits

The method described (“send → wait → suspend”) is presented strictly as a **personal practice**, not as guidance.

## Status

This repository currently contains:
- A public-facing article draft
- Supporting notes and versioned drafts

The material may evolve as observations are refined.
